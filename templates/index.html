        <h1>Input a NFL Team Name</h1>
        
        <p>The index '0' corresponds to the 2019 stats, whereas the '1' index refers to stats from 2020. <br/> My custom stat is the 'Missed stops' statistic - which weights each stat accordingly to give an indication <br/> of how often a defense can 'get off the field'.Teams with low Missed Stop % tend to have strong defenses. <br/> </p>

        <h1>Input a NFL QB Full Name</h1>
        
                <p>The index '0' corresponds to the 2019 stats, whereas the '1' index refers to stats from 2020. <br/> My custom stat is the 'Efficient Yards' statistic - which weights each stat accordingly to give an indication <br/> of how efficient a QB is- an adjustment over the Yards per Att metric. QBs with high Effiecent Yards over Average tend to be the Star QBs <br/> </p>

        <h1>Input a Blue Jays Hitter Last Name</h1>

        <p> Input a last name to see 2020 stats for some of the top hitters on this years Toronto Blue Jays Team. <br/> Options: Bichette, Guerrero Jr., Hernandez, Semien, Springer, Biggio, Grichuk (remember the period after Jr for Vladdy) </p>

        <h1>Input a Points Scored Number</h1>
        
        <p>A simple model based on the observation that as you score more in basketball, the defence has to focus on you more opening up oppertunities for your teamates.<br/> 
        It's also clear that these points are harder to come by because of that defence. Put in a number and you will recieve an adjusted point total (ex. 33 points is worth 35.55 points in this model).</p>
